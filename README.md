# TravelTim

## Project name: TravelTim

## Description:
This is my first big Android Project for my University project.
In this project, i tired to make an app for the visitors who want to visit Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. This app will give them some information and will suggest them to renowned restaurants, visiting places, hotels, shopping malls, and upcoming special event dates.

* Images compressed from (https://www.img-bak.in).
